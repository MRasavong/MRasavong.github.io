As an undergraduate research assistant and member of the cyberinfrastructure software development team at the University of Hawaii, I contribute to the Hawai‘i Climate Data Portal (HCDP), which provides streamlined access to climate data throughout the state. Currently, I am working on the Hawai‘i Mesonet, a user-friendly live data access tool integrated into the HCDP platform.

**The various features include:**
* Statewide advanced weather and climate monitoring network comprising approximately one hundred stations
* Utilizing sensor technology for real-time data collection and transmission, enabling continuous monitoring of weather conditions across Hawaii
* Rendering extreme spatial diversity of climate data, including temperatures, rainfall, cloud coverage, solar radiation, wind, and humidity

One of my responsibilities includes using Python and Jupyter Lab to request computing resources on Koa, UH's HPC cluster that recently became fully online on December 8th, 2023. In addition, I utilize the command-line program Rclone and the file transfer service Globus to move bulk scientific data over the network. Of course, while managing data transfer workflows, I have to take into account storage, network infrastructure, and end-point sites. Largescale file transfers are susceptible to network latency and packet loss, with part of my job being to minimize such risks. At the end of the semester, I am supposed to present an infographic about what I have learned throughout the project.

Being part of the project has enabled me to gain a deep understanding of how cyberinfrastructure works and the importance of HPC. With such large amounts of data being transferred at once across multiple campuses, computations must be performed at high speeds. I also gained an in-depth understanding of the command line—something that I have yet to cover in my ICS courses. One of my favorite lessons was on transmission control protocol, which transports protocol to ensure reliable transmission of packets. I hope to learn more over the semester as I venture into the world of networking.

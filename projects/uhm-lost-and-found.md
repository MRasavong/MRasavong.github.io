## Overview
  UHM Lost and Found is a web application dedicated to posting lost and found items for the University of Hawaii (UH) Manoa campus. Departments can post about lost items within their offices, enabling students to recognize their belongings and know exactly where they may find them. Currently, UH Manoa does not have a designated office or platform for lost and found items. Instead, they require students to remember where they lost their item and contact the associated department. This project aims to solve this issue by providing a centralized platform for posting and retrieving lost items.

**The website implements a variety of useful features, including:**
* A comprehensive database of lost items from various UH Manoa departments
* Multiple fields (name, date found, location found, current location, image URL, owner) for each lost item
* A simple Edit function to edit item fields or remove items for departmental and admin accounts
* Certain pages are public (Home, Lost Items), while others require departmental and/or admin accounts (Add Item, Edit Item, Departments, Add Department).
* Responsive design for mobile devices

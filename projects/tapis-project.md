As an undergraduate research assistant, I contribute to the Tapis Framework, which assists users in automating their research computing workflows and utilizes high-performance computing (HPC) clusters for deep-learning tasks. I also identify, communicate, and mitigate potential setbacks in collaboration with the University of Hawaii's Cyberinfrastructure team within the Information Technology Services department.

**The various features include:**\
Unified API for scheduling jobs to run on a variety of remote resources (supercomputers, Kubernetes clusters, physical servers, and Virtual Machines).\
Automating the data management lifecycle, including staging data inputs to the execution target and archiving job outputs to storage resources.\
Leveraging containerized application assets to enable portability and reduce overall time by utilizing data locality.

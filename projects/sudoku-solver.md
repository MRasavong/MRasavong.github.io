In ICS 211, I was given a homework assignment where I had to code a recursive algorithm in Java to solve Sudoku exercises. To test my algorithm, I used three different problemsâ€”the third being the AI Escargot, which is known to be one of the most difficult sudoku puzzles in the world. In my code, I utilized recursion to perform an exhaustive search with backtracking to identify the correct placements on the sudoku. Several functions included isFilled to check whether a sudoku has been filled or not and testSudoku which which solves the sudoku and tests the solution. The final result is then printed to the console as depicted in the image above.

This was an individual assignment where I had to demonstrate my understanding of recursion from the lectures.

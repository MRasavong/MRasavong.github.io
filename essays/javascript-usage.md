## Again?

  As someone who has used JavaScript before, it was a somewhat comforting feeling to be exposed to the programming language again. Previously, I created a command-line interface application in embedded JavaScript and Node.js that displayed real-time weather forecasts. In that sense, I was already familiar with most of the lessons of the Basic JavaScript module on freeCodeCamp. However, the ES6 module ended up being largely new to me. I learned about destructuring assignments to assign values taken directly from an object neatly. In addition, I gained an understanding of JavaScript promises, which take a function as an argument, with two parameters that determine whether a task has been fulfilled or not—much like an actual promise.

## Once Again Being Reminded of Why I Learned JavaScript in the First Place

  From a software engineering perspective, I consider JavaScript an incredibly versatile and beginner-friendly language. Not only does it have various frameworks from Angular to Meteor to choose from, but it can also be used to develop web, mobile, and desktop applications. Furthermore, it is supported across all major browsers—an essential facet for front-end programming. While I would personally prefer to use Java or Python for backend programming due to the multithreading support, JavaScript can be used for backend programming as well. The syntax was also one of the easiest for me to learn.

## And Again...

  The athletic software engineering classroom style and practice WODs have greatly helped me to refresh my memory of JavaScript by forcing me to directly engage with the material. Instead of consulting a textbook like in previous computer science classes, I am immediately given an IDE and an exercise to complete as I go through each lesson. Although I will not deny that the courseload will be stressful for me as the semester progresses, I am sure that it will enable me to truly dedicate myself to becoming proficient in both JavaScript and front-end programming as a whole. I have a strong feeling that this course will be one of the most useful classes for me in the long run as I strive to work in industry.

## Again?

  As someone who has used JavaScript before, I got this distinct feeling of deja vu from being exposed to the programming language again. Previously, I created a command-line interface application in embedded JavaScript and Node.js that displayed real-time weather forecasts. As such, I was already familiar with most of the lessons from the Basic JavaScript module on freeCodeCamp. However, the ES6 module ended up being largely new to me. As such, I learned about destructuring assignments to assign values taken directly from an object neatly. I also gained an understanding of JavaScript promises that take a function as an argument and determine whether a task has been fulfilled or not—much like an actual promise.

## Once Again Being Reminded of Why I Learned JavaScript in the First Place

  From a software engineering perspective, I consider JavaScript to be an incredibly versatile and beginner-friendly language. Not only does it have various frameworks from Angular to Meteor to choose from, but it can also be used to develop web, mobile, and desktop applications. Furthermore, it's supported across all major browsers—the opposite would defeat the purpose of front-end programming. While I would personally prefer to use Java or Python for backend programming due to the multithreading support, JavaScript can be used for backend programming as well. The first four letters also fooled me: JavaScript syntax was way easier for me to learn than Java.

## And Again!

  The athletic software engineering classroom style and practice WODs have helped me to refresh my memory of JavaScript by forcing me to directly engage with the material. Instead of consulting a textbook like in previous computer science classes, I'm immediately given an IDE and several exercises to complete as I go through each lesson. Although I won't deny that the courseload will be stressful for me in conjunction with my other classes, I'm sure that it will enable me to truly dedicate myself to becoming proficient in both JavaScript and front-end programming as a whole. I have a strong feeling that this course will be one of the most useful classes for me in the long run as I continue to strive toward working in industry someday.

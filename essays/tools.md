### I. Introduction

  Ever since the rise of artificial intelligence, its usage has been a heavily debated topic and source of controversy—especially in the educational domain. In this aspect, software engineering is in a unique position as both the founder of artificial intelligence (as artificial intelligence is software) and a field endangered by artificial intelligence.

I didn't use other artificial intelligence tools such as Bard or Co-Pilot for coding, with the former being because I had never heard of it before, and the latter because I wanted to fully memorize the code syntax.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have or haven't used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

1. I didn't use AI to solve the **experience WODs** and relied solely on learning resources such as documentation or Professor Johnson's videos, as I knew exactly what I was being asked to code and was given ample to prepare.
2. I used ChatGPT to help solve the timed in-class **practice WODs** (workouts of the day) relevant lines of code quickly and efficiently.
3. I used ChatGPT to help solve the timed **in-class WODs** for the same reasons above.
4. I didn't use ChatGPT to write **essays** as I have always enjoyed creative writing, with the ICS 314 essays being no exception. In my opinion, artificial intelligence cannot replicate the wit and altogether humane charm of personal writing. Grammar tools such as Grammarly, at least, in my free version (I despise subscription-based services), only correct basic spelling and punctuation errors in my writing.
5. The **final project** incorporated new features that didn't exist in the homework assignments, so I relied on ChatGPT to implement them into the rest of my code.
6. I didn't use AI to **learn a concept or tutorial** as I relied primarily on the material given to me by the instructors.
7. I didn't need to rely on AI to **answer a question in class or on Discord** since it was all content we had gone over before.
8. I didn't need to use AI to ask or answer **"smart questions"** simply because I rarely looked at that Discord channel.
9. I didn't use AI for **coding examples** such as "give an example of using Underscore .pluck” which are short and sweet. Hence, if I was stuck, I only needed to Google it.
10. I didn't use AI to **explain code** as all I had to do was translate code into plain English.
11. I didn't use AI to **write code** for the same reasons above.
12. I didn't use AI to **document code** because I had my code to paste onto the home page.
13. **Quality assurance** was where I used ChatGPT the most since it was highly convenient to have files with hundreds of lines of code automatically fixed for me.
14. I didn't use ChatGPT for any other purposes.

### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:

  While ChatGPT has helped to streamline the learning process by quickly alerting me on errors in my code and what I can do to solve them, I can't help but feel like it has also negatively impacted my overall coding skills since I'm not being forced to

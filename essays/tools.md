## "Be Not Simply Good—Be Good for Something"

  Ever since the rise of artificial intelligence, its usage has been a heavily debated topic and source of controversy—especially in the educational domain. In this aspect, software engineering is in a unique position as both the founder of artificial intelligence (as artificial intelligence is software) and a field endangered by artificial intelligence.

I didn't use other artificial intelligence tools such as Bard or Co-Pilot for coding, with the former being because I had never heard of it before, and the latter because I wanted to fully memorize the code syntax.

* In ICS 314, I primarily used ChatGPT to help solve the timed in-class **practice WODs** (workouts of the day) and **actual WODs**, as it would spit out relevant lines of code quickly and efficiently
* At home, I relied solely on learning resources such as documentation or Professor Johnson's videos to solve the **experience WODs**, as I knew exactly what I was being asked to code and was given ample to prepare
* **Essays** were where I drew the line at using ChatGPT. I have always enjoyed creative writing, and the ICS 314 essays were no exception. In my opinion, artificial intelligence cannot replicate the wit and altogether humane charm of personal writing. Grammar tools such as Grammarly, at least, in my free version (I despise subscription-based services), only correct basic spelling and punctuation errors in my writing
* The **final project** incorporated new features that didn't exist in the homework assignments, so I relied on ChatGPT to implement them into the rest of my code
* When it came to **learning a concept or tutorial**, I relied primarily on the material given to me by the instructors since ChatGPT is prone to numerous errors
* I didn't need to rely on AI to **answer a question in class or on Discord** since it was all content we had gone over before
* I didn't need to use AI to ask or answer **"smart questions"** simply because I rarely looked at that Discord channel
* I didn't use AI for **coding examples** such as "give an example of using Underscore .pluck” which are short and sweet. Hence, if I was stuck, I only needed to Google it
* I didn't use AI to **explain or write code** as I was translating code into plain English
* I didn't use AI to **document code** because I had my code to paste onto the home page
* **Quality assurance** was where I used ChatGPT the most since it was highly convenient to have files with hundreds of lines of code be automatically fixed for me
* I used ChatGPT to explain **terminal errors** since the learning material given to me did not cover my specific issues

  While ChatGPT has helped to streamline the learning process by quickly alerting me on errors in my code and what I can do to solve them, I can't help but feel like it has also negatively impacted my overall coding skills since I'm not being forced to

### I. Introduction

  Ever since the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), its usage has been a heavily debated topic and source of controversy within nearly all domains. The World Economic Forum has estimated that [AI will replace around 85 million jobs by 2025](https://www.weforum.org/press/2020/10/recession-and-automation-changes-our-future-of-work-but-there-are-jobs-coming-report-says-52c5162fce/). In this aspect, software engineering is in a unique position as both the founder of AI (as it's software) and a field potentially endangered by AI.

The only AI tool I have used generally and in ICS 314—not counting the existing usage of AI prevalent in so many applications like online chess games against a bot or consulting Windows' online virtual help tool—is ChatGPT. I avoided using Bard or Co-Pilot since I thought using one AI tool was more than enough for the course's difficulty level.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have or haven't used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

1. I didn't use AI to solve the **experience WODs** (workouts of the day) and relied solely on learning resources such as documentation or Professor Johnson's videos, as I knew exactly what I was being asked to code and given ample time to prepare.
2. I used AI to help solve the timed **in-class practice WODs** as ChatGPT can spit out relevant lines of code quickly and efficiently.\
   Example prompt: I wanted to align the columns in my footer toward the left more and asked "Align the columns in my footer slightly toward the left <footer code>."
4. I used AI to help solve the timed **in-class WODs** for the same reasons above.\
   Example prompt: I wanted to figure out why my background image wasn't showing and asked "Fix my background image not showing <landing page code and style.css code>."
6. I didn't use AI to write **essays** as I have always enjoyed creative writing, with the ICS 314 essays being no exception. AI cannot replicate the wit and altogether humane charm of personal writing.
7. The **final project** incorporated new features that didn't exist in the homework assignments, so I relied on AI to integrate them into the rest of my code.\
   Example prompt: I wanted to figure out how to have my Add Item page accept the user's images and asked "Add image field <Add Item page code and Lost Object component code>."
9. I didn't use AI to **learn a concept or tutorial** as I relied primarily on the material given to me by the instructors.
10. I didn't use AI to **answer a question in class or on Discord** since it was all content we had gone over before.
11. I didn't use AI to ask or answer **"smart questions"** frankly because I rarely looked at that Discord channel.
12. I didn't use AI for **coding examples** such as "give an example of using Underscore .pluck” because they are short and sweet. Hence, if I was stuck, I only needed to Google it.
13. I didn't use AI to **explain code** as all I had to do was translate code into plain English.
14. I used AI to **write code** as mentioned earlier when I stated that I used ChatGPT to solve the in-class WODs and integrate new features into my final project.\
    Example prompt: I wanted the footer to stay fixed to the screen no matter how far the user scrolled down and asked "Make footer fixed to screen <footer code>." 
16. I didn't use AI to **document code** as, again, I only needed to translate code into plain English. The raw code I did need already existed within my project to copy and paste.
17. **Quality assurance** was where I used AI the most since it was highly convenient to have files with hundreds of lines of code automatically fixed for me.\
    Example prompt: I wanted to resolve all ESLint errors in my code without going through each one manually and asked "Fix ESLint errors <file with ESLint errors>".
19. I didn't use AI for any other purposes.

### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:

  While ChatGPT has helped to streamline the learning process by quickly alerting me on errors in my code and what I can do to solve them, I can't help but feel like it has also negatively impacted my problem-solving skills in particular since ChatGPT can quickly resolve basic (syntax, logic) errors. Of course, anything beyond that was up in the air. I'm sure most people who have used ChatGPT can testify to its volatility in fixing advanced issues. My overall comprehension and coding skills have not been hindered greatly since I still learned from the resources given to me, including watching all of Professor Johnson's videos, reading documentation, and reviewing the modules. Overall, it has been a mixed experience.

### IV. Practical Applications:

  AI and machine learning tend to be used interchangeably, but machine learning is ultimately a subset of AI. Machine learning is a practical application of AI integral to many platforms, as users can feed data to an algorithm, which the algorithm then quickly analyzes to make a data-driven decision. Machine learning can process large amounts of data to identify trends and predict outcomes all seamlessly integrated into the platform's feed. AI has also been used in healthcare to identify cancer cells and detect diseases based on known symptoms. As for me, I have used weather tools that rely on AI to predict future forecasts in my personal and school projects.

### V. Challenges and Opportunities:

  As mentioned above, I have encountered varying levels of accuracy in what ChatGPT produces. The more advanced the issue, the more likely ChatGPT will solve it wrong. Even better? ChatGPT has occasionally completely rearranged that chunk of my code so that I receive more errors than what I originally had. Still, I think it would be helpful to have AI tools like ChatGPT continue being allowed in the course simply so that students can see what AI is capable of—and what they will be competing against in the job market. Machine learning (ICS 235, 435, 635) should continue being taught as it is a fundamental aspect of many platforms.

  In my personal opinion,

### I. Introduction

  Ever since the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), its usage has been a heavily debated topic and source of controversy within nearly all domains. The World Economic Forum has estimated that [AI will replace around 85 million jobs by 2025](https://www.weforum.org/press/2020/10/recession-and-automation-changes-our-future-of-work-but-there-are-jobs-coming-report-says-52c5162fce/). In this aspect, software engineering is in a unique position as both the founder of AI (as it's software) and a field potentially endangered by AI.

The only AI tool I have used generally and in ICS 314—not counting the existing usage of AI prevalent in so many applications like online chess games against a bot or consulting Windows' online virtual help tool—is ChatGPT. I avoided using Bard or Co-Pilot since I thought using one AI tool was more than enough for the course's difficulty level.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have or haven't used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

1. I didn't use AI to solve the **experience WODs** (workouts of the day) and relied solely on learning resources such as documentation or Professor Johnson's videos, as I knew exactly what I was being asked to code and given ample time to prepare.
2. I used AI to help solve the timed **in-class practice WODs** as ChatGPT can spit out relevant lines of code quickly and efficiently.\
   Example prompt: I wanted to align the columns in my footer toward the left more and asked "Align the columns in my footer slightly toward the left <footer code>."
3. I used AI to help solve the timed **in-class WODs** for the same reasons above.\
   Example prompt: I wanted to figure out why my background image wasn't showing and asked "Fix my background image not showing <landing page code and style.css code>."
4. I didn't use AI to write **essays** as I have always enjoyed creative writing, with the ICS 314 essays being no exception. AI cannot replicate the wit and altogether humane charm of personal writing.
5. The **final project** incorporated new features that didn't exist in the homework assignments, so I relied on AI to integrate them into the rest of my code.\
   Example prompt: I wanted to figure out how to have my Add Item page accept the user's images and asked "Add image field <Add Item page code and Lost Object component code>."
6. I didn't use AI to **learn a concept or tutorial** as I relied primarily on the material given to me by the instructors.
7. I didn't use AI to **answer a question in class or on Discord** since it was all content we had gone over before.
8. I didn't use AI to ask or answer **"smart questions"** because I knew how to format questions appropriately and would only answer questions I was confident about.
9. I didn't use AI for **coding examples** because they tended to be short and sweet. Hence, if I was stuck, I only needed to Google it.
10. I didn't use AI to **explain code** as all I had to do was translate code into plain English.
11. I used AI to **write code** as mentioned earlier when I stated that I used ChatGPT to solve the in-class WODs and integrate new features into my final project.\
    Example prompt: I wanted the footer to stay fixed to the screen no matter how far the user scrolled down and asked "Make footer fixed to screen <footer code>." 
12. I didn't use AI to **document code** as, again, I only needed to translate code into plain English. The raw code I did need already existed within my project to copy and paste.
13. **Quality assurance** was where I used AI the most since it was highly convenient to have files with hundreds of lines of code automatically fixed for me.\
    Example prompt: I wanted to resolve all ESLint errors in my code without going through each one manually and asked "Fix ESLint errors <file with ESLint errors>".
14. I didn't use AI for any other purposes.

### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:

  While ChatGPT has helped to somewhat streamline the learning process by quickly alerting me on errors in my code and what I can do to solve them, I can't help but feel like it has also negatively impacted my problem-solving skills in particular since ChatGPT can quickly resolve basic (syntax, logic) errors. Of course, anything beyond that was up in the air. I'm sure most people who have used ChatGPT can testify to its volatility in fixing advanced issues. My overall comprehension and coding skills have not been hindered greatly since I still learned from the resources given to me, including watching all of Professor Johnson's videos, reading documentation, and reviewing the modules. Overall, it has been a mixed experience.

### IV. Practical Applications:

  AI and machine learning tend to be used interchangeably, but machine learning is ultimately a subset of AI. Machine learning is a practical application of AI integral to many platforms, as users can feed data to an algorithm, which the algorithm then quickly analyzes to make a data-driven decision. Machine learning can process large amounts of data to identify trends and predict outcomes all seamlessly integrated into the platform's feed. AI has also been used in healthcare to identify cancer cells and detect diseases based on known symptoms. As for me, I have used weather tools that rely on AI to predict future forecasts in my personal and school projects.

### V. Challenges and Opportunities:

  As mentioned above, I have encountered varying levels of accuracy in what ChatGPT produces. The more advanced the issue, the more likely ChatGPT will solve it wrong. Even better? ChatGPT has occasionally completely rearranged that chunk of my code so that I receive more errors than what I originally had. Still, I think it would be helpful to have AI tools like ChatGPT continue being allowed in this course, specifically, so that students can see what AI is capable of—and what they will be competing against in the job market. Machine learning (ICS 235, 435, 635) should continue being taught as it is a fundamental aspect of many platforms.

### VI. Comparative Analysis:

 "Traditional" teaching materials, i.e., videos, PowerPoints, and textbooks, are better for overall knowledge retention and engagement since students are forced to learn the material rather than having the answer given immediately. Simply entering a prompt into a text field or having a line of code auto-filled for you does not constitute proper learning. To truly develop one's coding skills, the learner should begin by coding from scratch so they can truly understand the function of each line of code. However, ICS 314 should retain its AI-enhanced approaches to software engineering since the course aims to cover tools prevalent in the industry. For better or worse, AI has become widespread throughout the software engineering field and students should at least be aware of its impact—whether they want to use it or not is ultimately up to them.

### VII. Future Considerations:

  Ultimately, AI will likely harm overall software engineering education for students, who may become reliant on AI to code for them. AI tools like ChatGPT have become all-too-convenient for students to use as a clutch in replacement of a proper education. It should remain as it is: a tool that can be a part of a programmer's arsenal but will never replace the programmer's purpose itself. AI in general has been progressing at an alarming rate. At the minimum, students should have a fundamental understanding of the systems they are developing to overcome the standards AI has set.

### VIII. Conclusion:

  While AI should remain an *option* for students who wish to use it, as the purpose of the course is to provide students with an accurate overview of the state of the software engineering industry, students should also be cautioned about depending on AI too much. While integrating modern AI tools such as ChatGPT into software engineering education can provide valuable insights into industry practices and trends, it's crucial to maintain a balance between harnessing AI's capabilities and cultivating coding skills among students. While AI can expedite certain tasks and enhance overall productivity, overreliance on it may hinder the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. As the field continues to evolve, educators should adapt their approaches to ensure that students are equipped with the technical skills and the discernment necessary to navigate an AI-driven landscape effectively. By embracing AI as a supplementary tool rather than a crutch, students can harness its potential while preserving the integrity and ingenuity of the software engineering profession.

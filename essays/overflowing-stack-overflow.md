## The Numerous Benefits of Not Getting Laughed off of Stack Overflow

  Before taking this course, I was familiar with Stack Overflow and the stringent code of conduct the community bestows upon those unfortunate enough to ask questions that fail to meet their standards. The no-nonsense attitude common in those who frequent the site can appear intimidating to newcomers. Yet, asking smart questions is an essential skill for software engineers as it helps streamline the problem-solving process. Attempting to figure out the issue beforehand by inspecting the source code or searching the web saves would-be answerers time and ensures that you have learned from available resources. Even if you are unable to find the answer in the end, you can rest easy knowing that you have learned as much as you can—and won't appear like a fool when the time comes to ask the question.

## There Is No Such Thing as a Stupid Question, But-

  One smart question I found on Stack Overflow is this [**post**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8318911/why-does-html-think-chucknorris-is-a-color) asking why certain random strings produce colors when entered as background colors in HTML. It describes an issue not easily resolvable by searching the web and gives a snippet of the bugged code. On the other hand, this [**post**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1669/learning-to-write-a-compiler) asks a not-so-smart question in that they are asking about resources to learn how to write a compiler when they could find the answer immediately through a quick search query. Stack Overflow notes that the question does not meet their guidelines as it asks for recommendations for a tool, library, or favorite off-site resource, which could attract opinionated answers and spam. Instead, the site suggests describing the issue and what they have done to resolve it so far.

## Learning From Other People’s Mistakes 

  After browsing the various questions on Stack Overflow, I've noted several things that constitute smart and not-so-smart questions. Smart questions use meaningful, subject-specific headers and descriptions such that the issue is identifiable right off the bat. If it involves hardware, listing the exact part that is giving issues is highly helpful, while code should list an example of the line(s) outputting the incorrect results. As for not-so-smart questions, being incredibly vague about the issue or asking about something that could be resolved through a few seconds of searching through the web will likely land you quite a few dislikes and stinging comments. Describe the issue's symptoms and not what you guess is wrong with it and in chronological order.

## The Beginning of an Existential Crisis

I admit that when I first enrolled in the Computer Science program at UH Manoa, I had no idea what my exact career goals were. Computer Science has interdisciplinary collaborations with virtually every field that uses technology. Biology? Bioinformatics. Art? UX Design. Psychology? Cognitive Science. Unlike my usual lecture halls, the flipped classroom model that is particularly popular in computer science classes encouraged me to research different fields of interest and translate my findings in the form of personal projects and reflections. The freedom I was given to forge my path in life was intoxicating enough to be overwhelming, and I inevitably spiraled.

## Compartmentalizing

Stability has always been a key aspect of my life and requires strong foundations: I wanted mine to be built out of bedrock. I began looking for opportunities to incorporate different tools into my programming. When I wanted to implement real-time weather forecasts in my command-line application, I integrated the OpenWeatherMap API to include temperatures in Celsius and Fahrenheit, cloud coverage, visibility, humidity, atmospheric pressure, precipitation, and wind. When my research project required me to contribute to securely managing large computational workloads across campuses, I utilized high-performance computing clusters to perform the tasks quickly and efficiently. I sought stability in software engineering and found it in the form of a potential future career.

## Now What?

There are still times when my creative side pops up while buried in lines and lines of code. Outside of my major, I prefer writing over typing, and most of my interests don't particularly require the usage of a computer. Still, that doesn't necessarily mean that I can't be creative when coding. Recently, I've been looking into using machine learning to create my own video game after reading about how the developers of Chess (my favorite online game) simulated the playing styles of famous historical chess players using AI. While I'm still not completely set on what career I want to go into, I'll continue to keep myself busy with different projects and opportunities and see where it goes from here.
